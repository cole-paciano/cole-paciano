- 👋 Hi, I’m @cole-paciano
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Graphic Design. Stated off as a Graphic Designer but with the advent of the internet fell in love with coding. It's actually a love/hate thing.
- 🌱 I just finished learning Vue and generally like it. My current dev stack is a node/express server, mongodb database, EJS templates, and Web Components with Javascript to server as a frontend framework. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
- 📫 How to reach me ...You can reach me at cole@thecreatedev.com
