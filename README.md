- 👋 Hi, I’m @cole-paciano
- Since I've been working solo for a while now, I mainly use GitHub for backing up numerous projects but don't make them publicly available.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Graphic Design. I started as a Graphic Designer but with the advent of the internet fell in love with coding.
- 🌱 My current dev stack is a backend running node/express server, MongoDB database, and React as the client. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and I'm ready to make things.
