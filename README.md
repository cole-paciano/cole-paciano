- 👋 Hi, I’m @cole-paciano
- Since I've been working solo for awhile now, I mainly use github for backing up numerous projects but don't make them publicly available.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and Graphic Design. I started off as a Graphic Designer but with the advent of the internet fell in love with coding.
- 🌱 My current dev stack/mantra is a backend running node/express server, mongodb database, EJS templates, and Web Components with Javascript to serve as a frontend framework. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and I'm ready to make things.
- 📫 You can reach me at: cole@thecreatedev.com
